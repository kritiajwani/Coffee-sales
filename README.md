coffee chain, can be used for a variety of mining tasks, including classifying the data and predicting an outcome. 
Here Decision Trees Regression and Random Forest Regressions are selected for predicting profit of each product type in different markets, as well as classifying markets based on product and sales. 


To predict The sales of each product type based on the sales.

There were some redundant features that were removed using the drop() function. 
The dataset also had a date column which was converted to the appropriate date time for later 


To find a correlation of features - the Profit and Target Profit difference gave us the gain among the prediction margin

To find patterns the graph was plotted considering the feature present in the dataset.

The features included 

Area Code - Code of the area where the product was sold
Date - Date and time when the  product was sold
Inventory - record of stock after purchase
Market Size - Market Size for a product selling (eg.,Major, Minor)
Market - Market Location (eg., West, Central, North, East, South)
Product Type - Type of the Product (eg., Herbal Tea, Coffee, Espresso, etc.)
Product - Product Name (eg., Colombian, Green Tea, Lemon, etc.) 
Profit - profit
Sales - Sales made
State - States of US 
Target Profit - Profit targeted  for the specific product
Total Expenses - Expenses incurred 
Type - Type of coffee 


This project was focused more on data mining techniques
